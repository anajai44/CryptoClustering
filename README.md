# CryptoClustering

## Issues I encountered while working:

I was having issues with my graphs. I reach out to to AskBCs and we went over graphing in general. I had my graphs right, but for some reason they weren't still showing. In conclusion, what ended up solving my problem was restarting my computer. Once I restarted my computer, the graphs started to show in VS Code.
Even though, they're showing in VS Code, I don't understand why aren't they showing here, in GitHub, in my code.
In addtion, I learned that I should commit & push more often than doing it once or twice.
Therefore, attached are my graphs to prove that they show in my VS Code.
